Here are **20 feature-rich system service tools** you can build **fully in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (client-side or with optional backend/API support) — ideal for web-based diagnostics, monitoring, OSINT, security, and admin utilities:

---

## 🔧 System Services (HTML/CSS/JS Tool Ideas)

### 🧠 1. **System Info Viewer**

* Show device CPU, memory, screen resolution, OS, browser, battery, network.
* Use: `navigator`, `window`, `performance.memory`.

---

### 🌐 2. **Network Speed & Latency Tester**

* Run download/upload tests (XHR blobs), show latency, jitter.
* Optional: Draw speed graphs with `<canvas>`.

---

### 🔍 3. **Process Explorer (Web Tab Analyzer)**

* List open tabs (limited), background processes, CPU usage (simulated).
* Requires permissions or simulation in browser.

---

### 🗂️ 4. **Disk Usage Visualizer**

* Local file picker to show directory tree sizes using the File System Access API.
* Display pie or sunburst chart of space usage.

---

### 📡 5. **Ping & Traceroute Simulator**

* Simulate ICMP pings and hop path to an IP/domain.
* Traceroute uses `fetch` + timing to simulate hop counts.

---

### 🌐 6. **IP & DNS Toolkit**

* Lookup IP address, reverse DNS, geo IP, ASN, DNS records.
* Real APIs: `ipapi`, `ipinfo`, `cloudflare-dns.com`.

---

### 🔐 7. **Password Strength Auditor**

* Test password strength, entropy, leaks (with HIBP or local hashes).
* Show real-time analysis as user types.

---

### 📁 8. **File Manager (Local/Remote)**

* Explore local files via File System Access API.
* Include editing, ZIP/Extract, image previews, JSON/CSV viewers.

---

### 📸 9. **Screenshot & Screen Recorder**

* Use `MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` to capture screen.
* Save frames or full video using `MediaRecorder`.

---

### 🕵️ 10. **OSINT Intelligence Dashboard**

* Aggregate data from email, domain, IP, username checks.
* APIs: emailrep.io, haveibeenpwned, hunter.io, etc.

---

### 🔎 11. **Malware Scanner & Hash Checker**

* Upload file → show SHA256/MD5 hashes.
* Integrate VirusTotal, HybridAnalysis, or OPSWAT API (optional).

---

### 🧪 12. **API Tester / REST Client**

* Like Postman: Send custom HTTP requests, show headers, body, status.
* Save request history locally.

---

### ⚡ 13. **Command Palette / Launcher**

* Web-based `command prompt` for running defined actions.
* e.g., `open IP scanner`, `run geo lookup`, `zip folder`, `save log`.

---

### 📶 14. **WiFi & Network Analyzer (Simulated)**

* Simulate scan of nearby SSIDs, channel congestion.
* Real WiFi API access is limited in browsers — use mock data or hybrid app.

---

### 📊 15. **Real-Time System Monitor (Simulated)**

* Simulate CPU, RAM, Disk, Net activity with animated graphs.
* Optionally use actual browser performance data (if available).

---

### 🧯 16. **Web Security Auditor**

* Scan a website for:

  * Insecure cookies
  * CORS headers
  * Missing CSP
  * HTTP/HTTPS redirection
  * X-Frame-Options
* Use `fetch()` and inspect headers.

---

### 🌍 17. **GeoMap Tracker & Visualizer**

* Get location from user or IP → show on Leaflet/OpenStreetMap.
* Optionally animate movement paths.

---

### 🔒 18. **Access Log Analyzer**

* Drag-and-drop `access.log` → parse IPs, user agents, hits, bots.
* Graph request trends, top visitors.

---

### 🧮 19. **JSON Log Viewer & Beautifier**

* Drop in JSON log files.
* Show formatted tree view, search keys, highlight changes live.

---

### 🧰 20. **Web Terminal Shell (Simulated Bash)**

* Create a fake bash terminal that supports `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `echo`, etc.
* Fully client-side with virtual FS structure in JS.

---

## ⚙️ Advanced Integration Options (Optional Backend)

* **Docker Container Manager UI**
* **Service Startup Checker**
* **Syslog Collector (web viewer)**
* **Device Scanner via WebUSB/WebSerial**
* **Windows Event Log Viewer (via Electron or remote fetch)**
