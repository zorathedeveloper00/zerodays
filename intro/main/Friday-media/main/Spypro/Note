Creating a fully functional and unlimited "Spy Scanner" that continuously monitors your device for vulnerabilities and potential spying threats is a complex task that typically requires a dedicated application with access to system-level resources. However, as a web-based application, there are inherent limitations due to browser security policies that prevent access to system-level information.

### Important Considerations
1. **Browser Limitations**: Web applications cannot access system files, processes, or perform continuous monitoring in the same way that native applications can. They are sandboxed for security reasons.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities and spying threats typically requires a background service or application with elevated permissions, which is not feasible with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alone.
3. **Local Usage**: You can run the provided code locally on your machine, but it will still be limited to what the browser can access.

### Enhanced Spy Scanner Tool
Below is an enhanced version of the previous code that simulates a more comprehensive scanning process. It includes features for checking permissions, listing media devices, and providing user feedback. However, please remember that this tool will still be limited to the capabilities of the browser.
